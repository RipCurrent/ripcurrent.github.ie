## Applications

### App Registrations
- Use App Registration to register *your* application for use with AD

### Enterprise Application
- Use these to register an instance of this application. Other organisations could have an Enterprise Application for your App Registration.
- You'll see many Enterprise applications listed as this will contain those which are used by your organisation but built but others (e.g. Adobe etc)
  
### Web App
- create a web application (does not need an App Registration etc)
- push code to this using GIT. This is a great option, can set this for CI.
- note the use of logs under *App Service Logs*
