# Agile Learnings
Some random thoughts, no particular structure at the moment

## The Standup
well running:
- Show the overview chart (what is this?)
- don't get bogged down in specific issues -> move to additional meeting
- ask for updates
  - refer to Issue #
  - summary level
  - blockers?
- no time overrun

gather thoughts, say confidently
