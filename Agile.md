# Agile Learnings
Some random thoughts, no particular structure at the moment

## The Standup
well running:
- Show the overview chart (what is this?)
  - This is the Dashboard page
  - in Round robin Updates section, Core Teams comes in an adds
    - Completed, in progresss, todo, reivew,  blocked (with issue numbers - title can be helpful)
    - 
- don't get bogged down in specific issues -> move to additional meeting
- ask for updates
  - refer to Issue #
  - summary level
  - blockers?
- no time overrun

gather thoughts, say confidently
