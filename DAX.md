# Overview of DAX
DAX is:
- a functional language. everything is an expression

## The Model
In Analysis services we work with a Tabular model. This model is made up of
- tables and
- relationships.
The standard relationship can be:
  - 1:* one to many
Spcial relationships are:
- 1:1
- many to many

## Compared to...
### Excel
DAX works on tables and columns, not cells

### SQL
Relationships. SQL you must state. DAX inherited from the model
Subqueries. SQL write another query. DAX use Filter
